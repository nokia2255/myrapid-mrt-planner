A lightweight, responsive, and smart web utility designed for Klang Valley (Kuala Lumpur) commuters to predict train arrivals, calculate multi-line transit fares, and audit whether the RM50 **My50 Unlimited Travel Pass** is financially worth buying based on custom date ranges and weekend filters.

## ✨ Features

- **Integrated Multi-Line Journey Planner**: Covers all major high-density rail lines in Klang Valley including:
  - 🟢 MRT Kajang Line (KG)
  - 🟡 MRT Putrajaya Line (PY)
  - 🔴 LRT Kelana Jaya Line (KJ)
  - 🟠 LRT Ampang Line (AG)
  - 🟣 LRT Sri Petaling Line (SP)
- **Smart Interchange Routing & Walk Estimations**: Dynamically detects if transfer is needed between lines (e.g. KLCC to Bukit Bintang) and factors in physical transit/walk timings.
- **Accurate Fare Differentiation**: Precise calculations matching Rapid KL's structures, fully distinguishing **Cashless (Touch 'n Go)** fares from **Cash** fares.
- **Advanced Multi-Period Pass Planner**: 
  - Schedule multiple custom commute legs across different dates (e.g., Oct 2–5 to one station, Oct 6–10 to another).
  - Apply weekday-only filters (automatically excluding weekends) or weekend-only filters.
  - Track pay-as-you-go cumulative totals on an interactive progress bar compared against the **RM 50.00** My50 pass limit.
- **Offline-First Timetable Engine**: Automatically calculates headway countdowns based on simulated peak hours (4 min intervals) and off-peak hours (6–10 min intervals) so it never fails or lags.
